              <br/>
              <p><font size="3">Welcome to my project website.</font><p> 
              <p font size="3">I enjoy harvesting information from remote sensing and social-economic datasets and eventually building models that explain and predict.<p>
              <p>Most of the projects I have done so far combined data and climate models, and focused on the climate feedback of landcover changes. I currently use Python as my everyday tool, but have worked with Matlab and R as well.<p>
              <p>Through these projects, I have acquired experiences working with Linux clusters, parallel computing, machine learning and model optimization.<p>
              <p>I currently hold a B.S. in Ecology from Peking University and M.S. in Earth System Science from Univeristy of California Irvine. I also enjoy playing guitar and cello and doing <a href="https://500px.com/Liu_Guo">photography</a> when I have a chance.<p>
