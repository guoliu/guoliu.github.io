              <p><font size="3">Welcome to my project website.</font><p> 
              <p font size="3">I am interested in harvesting infomation from remote sensing and social-economic datasets, using methods such as model optimization and machine learning, and eventually building models that explain and predict.<p>
              <p>Most of the projects I have done so far are on  the relationships among human activity, fire, vegetation and climate system, using remote sensing data and climate models.<p>
              <p>Through these projects, I have acquired experiences working with Linux clusters, parallel computing, machine learning and model optimization.<p>
              <p>I currently hold a B.S. in Ecology from Peking University and M.S. in Earth System Science from Univeristy of California Irvine. I also enjoy playing guitar and cello and doing <a href="https://500px.com/Liu_Guo">photography</a> when I have a chance.<p>
