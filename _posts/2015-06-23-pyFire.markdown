_`Remote Sensing, GIS, Python, GDAL`_

Package [pyFire](https://github.com/guoliu/pyFire) written in Python for fire analysis. It provides: 

* GIS functions e.g. reprojection, vector masking, area cacluation, and scripts for handling MODIS data;
* statistic analysis e.g. quantile regression, seasonality decomposition and correlation plots; 
* classes for handling Community Earth System Model landsurface data and modeling vegetation growth. 

This package relies on [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/).
